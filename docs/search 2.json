    "text": "1. Cancer Epidemiology\nCancer Epidemiology and Global Burden of Disease\nCancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Quantifying the epidemiology, temporal trends, and attributable risk factors of cancer is essential for guiding prevention and public health strategies. My research focuses on cancer epidemiology and global burden assessments, using population-based registries and global burden databases to characterize incidence, mortality, and preventable risk factors in China and worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Colorectal Cancer Screening Strategies\nCohort studies, population-based programs, and RCTs.\nColorectal cancer is among the most preventable cancers through effective screening. Designing optimal strategies for large populations such as in China remains a major challenge. I conduct cohort-based studies, population-based investigations, and large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate participation, diagnostic performance, and long-term outcomes of screening methods (e.g., colonoscopy, FIT), providing evidence for population-adapted screening pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Novel Screening Technologies\nMulti-omics biomarkers and risk prediction models.\nTraditional screening tools have limitations in sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability. My work emphasizes the development and validation of novel screening technologies, including multi-omics biomarkers (genomics, methylation, microbiome, metabolomics, proteomics) and advanced risk prediction models. I particularly focus on integrating enviromental risk scores (ERS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), metagenomics risk scores (MRS), and proteomic markers to establish precise and individualized cancer risk prediction tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Health Economics & Modeling\nMicrosimulation and cost-effectiveness evaluation.\nBeyond clinical performance, cancer screening strategies must be economically viable. I employ microsimulation modeling and decision-analytic approaches to project long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and resource implications of various screening strategies. These studies provide robust evidence for healthcare decision-making and policy formulation in cancer prevention and early detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. AI & Large Language Models\nAI-driven imaging, NLP, and protocol evaluation.\nThe rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for cancer screening and clinical research. I explore AI-driven imaging, natural language processing, and decision-support systems to improve colorectal cancer risk stratification and screening management.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Methodology & Quality Control\nImproving rigor in clinical research.\nHigh-quality clinical research is fundamental to evidence-based medicine, yet many studies face challenges in design, implementation, and reporting. I lead the development of methodological evaluation frameworks and intelligent support systems for clinical research, enabling comprehensive quality control across the research lifecycle. These initiatives improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, contributing to the advancement of clinical research quality in China and globally. In parallel, I investigate the use of LLMs for automated evaluation of clinical trial protocols, aiming to enhance the quality and efficiency of cancer research."

    "text": "Our group is currently conducting several interdisciplinary projects focusing on precision prevention, early detection, and clinical research methodology.\nThese projects integrate genomics, microbiome, AI/LLMs, and health policy modeling, aiming to transform colorectal cancer screening and prevention strategies in China and globally.\n\n\n\nRisk-adapted Screening for Colorectal Cancer\nWe conducted the first large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in China to compare the feasibility, participation, and diagnostic yield of risk-adapted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) — the TARGET-C trial. Approximately 20,000 participants aged 50–74 years were enrolled. The trial has built a comprehensive database and biobank, forming a robust platform for future CRC prevention and early detection research.\n\n\nPolygenic Risk Score for Colorectal Cancer\nWe are developing and validating polygenic risk score (PRS) models by integrating data from the China Kadoorie Biobank and multiple population-based screening cohorts. This project aims to provide precise estimation of individual absolute risk and enable large-scale, genetics-informed risk-adapted screening.\n\n\nGut Microbiome and CRC\nWe investigate gut microbial signatures and host–microbiome interactions influencing CRC development. Integrating metagenomic, lifestyle, and genetic data, we build metagenomic risk scores (MRS) for early detection, and study how environmental and genetic factors shape the microbiome and carcinogenesis.\n\n\nAI and Large Language Models for Cancer Prevention\nDeveloping AI- and LLM-driven platforms for the end-to-end management of cancer screening — from intelligent risk assessment to personalized follow-up. A pilot study, INTEL-PATH CRC, is evaluating the feasibility of AI-assisted screening strategies in real-world settings.\n\n\nHealth Economics & Policy Simulation\nApplying microsimulation and decision-analytic models to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both primary (risk factor control) and secondary (screening-based) prevention strategies for CRC. These analyses guide evidence-based policy and optimize prevention resources.\n\n\nLifestyle and Cancer Comorbidity\nInvestigating how lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, metabolic status) influence comorbidity patterns between cancer and chronic diseases. The project identifies modifiable risks and promotes integrated prevention and survivorship care.\n\n\nNovel plasma proteomics-based colorectal cancer screening biomarker\nUsing mass spectrometry–based plasma proteomics to discover and validate circulating protein biomarkers for early colorectal cancer detection. By integrating proteomic, genetic, and clinical data, this project enhances non-invasive colorectal cancer screening and early-detection tools.\n\n\nCREDIT: Clinical Research Intelligent Design & Evaluation Tool\nCREDIT is an AI-empowered platform for clinical research design, evaluation, and quality management. Leveraging large language models and knowledge-graph reasoning, it assesses study rigor and provides automated feedback aligned with international standards (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA).\n\n\nIntegrated Screening for Upper Gastrointestinal and Colorectal Cancer\nDeveloping a combined screening strategy for upper GI and colorectal cancers in high-altitude Tibetan populations, integrating endoscopic and non-invasive methods to improve efficiency and explore shared etiological pathways.\n\n\nGlobal Lifetime Risk and Preventable Burden of Colorectal Cancer\nQuantifying the global lifetime risk and preventable incidence of colorectal cancer attributable to modifiable risk factors across countries worldwide. This study will use comparative modeling and population-attributable risk estimation to assess regional variations and identify the potential impact of targeted prevention strategies, providing evidence to guide international cancer prevention and screening policies.\n\n\nCervical cancer screening and triaging strategy\nFor women at high risk of cervical cancer, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of E6/E7 mRNA testing, DNA methylation markers, dual-stain cytology (p16/Ki-67), and conventional cytology in triaging hrHPV-positive cases. We aim to compare their diagnostic performance and explore the optimal triaging strategy that achieves a balance between accuracy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness."
